		<h1>Intellectual Property Rights</h1>
		<div><h3>What is Intellectual Property?</h3>
		<p>Intellectual property is a legal concept where people or legal entities are allowed to have ownership over a concept or idea. There are many forms of intellectual property, including the following:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Patents</li>
			<li>Copyrights</li>
			<li>Trademarks</li>
		</ul>
		<p>This allows Intellectual Property (IP) holders to incite legal action against people or organizations that are making use of the idea and concepts which are their intellectual property in a way that they do not want. For example, if you wanted to add a feature to a piece of software and share that feature with other people, you could be prosecuted for violating the software publisher's IP.</p>
		<p>There are many different organizations involved in IP law, especially internationally, but in the united states there are two main branches: The US Patent and Trademark Office, and the US Copyright Office. The USPTO registers both Patents, or inventions and innovations, and Trademarks, or brand information. The UCO registered Copyright, or individual works and the ideas therein. Notably algorithims and broad process can be patented, while entire pieces software can be copyrighted.

		<div><h3>Why does Intellectual Propert Exist?</h3>
		<p>
		Proponents of intellectual property argue that it promotes innovation by letting inventors and artists profit off of their work. Without intellectual property rights, they argue, no one would put time and effort into developing a new technology if their competitors would also gain the benefits without having to spend that time and effort. This would lead, the argument goes, to less people and companies developing their own innovations as they could get away with profitting from the innovations of others. Furthermore, many companies, such as ARM Holdings, rely on Intellectual Property Rights in order to make money, as their business model is making money off of license fees. Furthermore, IP law insures that creators of all types are able to earn money because of their creation.

		<p>
			The Constitution of the United States of America states that Congress is allowed "To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries;" which is why the USPTO and USCO were able to be established. This is also the basis by which the laws which govern IP in the US were passed.

		<div><h3>Criticisms of Intellectual Property</h3>
			<p>Many economists and political theorists have criticized the concept of intellectual property rights. Many claim that IP rights actually <i>reduce</i> innovation. They claim that IP laws give IP holders a false monopoly by preventing anyone from competing with them. For example, if Company A developed a unique new beneficial drug, only Company A is allowed to produce and sell it. Would-be competitors are prevented by law from developing a cheaper way of producing it or discovering other uses it might have, and thus Company A has no pressure to do either of those things, meaning those innovations have been discouraged. In fact, as Company A is a company it has an incentive to sell the drug for as much money as it can. This leads directly into the second common argument against IP, specifically Patent, law; that it leads to worse outcomes for people using patentable inventions, which in the case of an industry like pharmaceuticals could be fatal. Drug patents specifically are often focused on by anti-patent activists because they frequently limit the production and access of life-saving medication, however in other fields a similar effect applies.</p>
			<p>Another common argument against IP rights is the fact that they fail to ensure that the creator of an idea actually profits of it, even if the idea is profitable. Most IP is not in fact owned by the person who created it, but by the company they worked for when they created it. This means that if an inventor creates an idea that is the foundation for a product line that made a million dollars, they could be fired and disallowed from starting their own business off of it because their former company owned the patent. Even if a creator is independant and does own their own IP, that doesn't garuantee that IP law will protect them if a much larger corporation steals their idea, as they might not have enough money to pay for the legal fees involved, especially as the corporation can definitely afford it.</p>
