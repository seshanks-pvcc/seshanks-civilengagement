		<h1>Intellectual Property Rights</h1>
		<div><h3>What is Intellectual Property?</h3>
		<p>Intellectual property is a legal concept where people or legal entities are allowed to have ownership over a concept or idea. There are many forms of intellectual property, including the following:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Patents</li>
			<li>Copyrights</li>
			<li>Trademarks</li>
		</ul>
		<p>This allows Intellectual Property (IP) holders to incite legal action against people or organizations that are making use of the idea and concepts which are their intellectual property in a way that they do not want. For example, if you wanted to add a feature to a piece of software and share that feature with other people, you could be prosecuted for violating the software publisher's IP.</p>
		<p>There are many different organizations involved in IP law, especially internationally, but in the united states there are two main branches: The US Patent and Trademark Office, and the US Copyright Office. The USPTO registers both Patents, or inventions and innovations, and Trademarks, or brand information. The UCO registered Copyright, or individual works and the ideas therein. Notably algorithims and broad process can be patented, while entire pieces software can be copyrighted.

		<div><h3>Why does Intellectual Propert Exist?</h3>
		<p>
			Proponents of intellectual property argue that it promotes innovation by letting inventors and artists profit off of their work. Without intellectual property rights, they argue, no one would put time and effort into developing a new technology if their competitors would also gain the benefits without having to spend that time and effort.
